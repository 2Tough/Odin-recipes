Recipes

This project is my first odin project. Altough I already have some experience with
HTML and CSS, this will be a good practice to refresh all the basics I've learned.
Since I saw a couple of brutalist sites, I want to try out that design for this project.

Main section added

Included img, description, ul with ingredients and ol with steps. Started new section with new recipes.

Trying out git options

The features of git add and commit are not properly showing up. This is a test.

Added and completed new section

Done in the same format as previous one.

Final update including final recipe

Included final recipe: Agua dulce. This finishes the projects HTML. If necessary, next steps are CSS styling.

Added CSS Styling

Changed background, color and edited body, h1 and h2.
